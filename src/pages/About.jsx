          Hello, I'm Prajwal A K, a second-year Computer Science Engineering student at MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology. My journey in the world of technology began with Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. Over the past 1.5 years, I've mastered DSA concepts and continually practice to sharpen my skills.

          Moving forward, I ventured into web development, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building on my foundation, I transitioned to React and developed various projects. Expanding into full-stack development, I explored the MERN stack, incorporating technologies like Tailwind CSS and integrating OpenAI APIs.

          In the dynamic web landscape, I embraced the rise of Next.js, mastering its concepts and applying them to real-world projects. To add a creative touch, I delved into Three.js and related libraries, crafting immersive 3D experiences. My proficiency extends to utilizing APIs and cloud services.

          As I progress in my academic and coding journey, I'm excited about the endless possibilities technology offers. Join me on this exploration as we dive into innovation and create meaningful solutions.
